The simplest and easiet way to stop bad web crawlers, bots  and referrer spammers from targeting your wordpress website

== Description ==


 Stop Web Crawlers has been developed to block referrer spam attacks on your WordPress website.  
 
 Stop Web Crawlers will reduce the likelihood that your site will be crawled by the Referrer spammers like;
 
  Semalt.com, Darodar, buttons-for-website, ilovevitaly.co  and 100's of others,  by sending 403 access prohibited error response when these notorious
 referrer spammers attempt to crawl your site.


The additional functionality planned for this plugin for the future is also to remove Ghost Referrer spammers from accessing your Google Analytics.

  
 There is no need to edit your .htaccess or mess around with robots.txt, all is required is too install the plugin and activate the plugin.  
 
 The plugin is currently designed to run unattended and automatically.
 
 There is a settings section, but this is currently only a placeholder for future functionality, which will be activated in future releases of the plugin.

 Other bots will be added to the block list over time via updates to this plugin.
