<h4>What's new ?</h4>
<p>In this release of Stop Web Crawlers we have started work on developing our new database structure to enable
the delivery of even greater protection from web bots in forthcoming releases.</p>
<p>At present Stop Web Crawlers only provides protection against Referer spammers, however in later releases
we will be providing protection against Scrapers, Impersonators and Crackers. All these malicious bots are a threat to your site.</p>
<p>We had to carry out remedial work on the data structure and also make several improvements to our underlying code base.</p>
<p>We have also started work to our automated updates feature and developing our online bot repository, which we will be releasing 
out Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release by end of November.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank you for your support, and appreciate your continued use of our fledgling product. We would appreciate any comments
, feedback, criticism, observations, feature requests or bug reports to help us improve.</p>

<p>We anticipate another release of Stop Web Crawlers to be available by the end of October 2016</p>
